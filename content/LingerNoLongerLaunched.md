Ambitious businessmen who are willing to fund political stardom via criminal wealth abound. Few are as methodical, 
pragmatic and visionary as Michael is. Used to getting what he wants every single time, Michael is caught unaware by 
Allison – his wife and business co-host – who decides, in a daring move, to make a run for it. Escape, run away.

Luckily, Allison, who soon becomes Marianne, finds herself an expert on the battered-women disappearing business. 
Diana lives to save other women’s lives. Always aware of her surroundings, anticipating events, she is able to make 
Marianne and herself invisible for seven full days. Until she does not.

In a chase full of near misses and ingenious ways, the dangerous game run by professionals goes on rhythmically and 
authentically until a first death triggers vengeance. On the side of the hunters, the contract becomes personal. 
The escapees in turn realize they cannot run forever. Slowly, building up a curious and unlikely team, the hunted 
realize their only way out is to fight back.

Linger No Longer is a contemporaneous female-focused thriller, that depicts a detailed and dangerous flight for 
life and how it can change people and their perspectives.
